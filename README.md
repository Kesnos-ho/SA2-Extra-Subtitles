## About

This mod displays subtitles for most voice lines with no text originally that you can encounter during normal play.

Subtitles will be displayed for the following:
* menu screens
* idle voices (common, stage specific)
* other stage-specific voices (e.g. story mode-only Eggman's lines for Crazy Gadget)
* rank voices
* victory lines
* some gameplay voices (e.g. item get, hunting, kart racing, Omochao bullying, etc.)
* boss battle voices
* 2P Battle voices (some gameplay lines and intros)
* last episode ending cutscene voices

At this point the mod will NOT display subtitles for voices in soundbanks (e.g. light dash or kart boost voices).

Currently supported languages:
* English (dub)
* Japanese (experimental)

Other features (for all languages in the game):
* fix main menu text if [Menu Overhaul](https://gamebanana.com/mods/33169) mod is enabled
* fix exit messages displaying out of the text box if [Render Fix](https://gamebanana.com/mods/452445) mod is enabled and uses "Compact" or higher letter spacing (but probably not higher than "Comfy")

This mod does NOT feature retranslated English subtitles as they are a part of [Retranslated Story -COMPLETE-](https://gamebanana.com/mods/437858) mod.
Contributions for other languages (French, Spanish, German, Italian) would be appreciated.
